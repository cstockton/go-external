## About

Package external makes source available from the Go standard libraries
internal package. It contains a lot of very useful code in pprof/profile and
trace it's well worth losing the [go1compat](https://golang.org/doc/go1compat)
promise for me. I don't suggest using this package, copy the makefile and pick
out the internals you want.
